## Contributing

1. Familiarize yourself with the codebase by reading the [docs](docs), in
   particular the [development](contributing/developing.md) doc.
1. Create a new issue before starting your project so that we can keep track of
   what you're trying to add/fix. That way, we can also offer suggestions or
   let you know if there is already an effort in progress.
1. Fork this repository.
1. The [development](contributing/developing.md) doc has details on how to set up your environment.
1. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork based on the correct branch (usually the **develop** branch, see [Branches section](#branches)). Note: this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
1. Edit the code in your fork.
1. Sign CLA (see [CLA](#cla).
1. Send us a pull request when you're done. We'll review your code, suggest any
   needed changes, and merge it in.

## Pull Requests

### Committing

1. We enforce commit message format. We recommend using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) by installing it with `npm install -g commitizen` and running `npm run commit-init`. When you commit, we recommend that you use `npm run commit`, which prompts you with a series of questions to format the commit message. Or you can use our VS Code Task `Commit`.
1. The commit message format that we expect is: `type: commit message`. Valid types are: feat, fix, improvement, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore and revert.
1. Before commit and push, Husky runs several hooks to ensure the commit message is in the correct format and that everything lints and compiles properly.
